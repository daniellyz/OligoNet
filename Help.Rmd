### Help

Recent technical advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) have made metabolomics experiments commonplace for a wide variety of disciplines. In most studies, a database search is performed to translate mass signals into concrete metabolites, and to further interpret the data in a biological and genomic context. However, this annotation approach is limited by the size of database, therefore many detected mass signals are classified as unknowns without being further considered. OligoNet implements an alternative method to annotate metabolomics data based on the assumption that some higher-molecular-weight "unknowns" are combinations of repeated subunits (residues). The current version of the web server is dedicated to provide putative annotations of peptides in full scan direct infusion MS or LC/GC-MS data. For this purpose, OligoNet attempts to decompose each mass input into a combination(s) of  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/amino-acid-full.txt" target="_blank"> 17 proteinogenic amino acids </a>. It either uses a recursive algorithm or requests the third-party web server <a href="https://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/decomp" target="_blank"> DECOMP </a>. OligoNet provides  user-friendly ouputs for metabolomic experiments, including the display of decomposition results on the web interface, parallel KEGG database annotation, visualization of annotated peptides in KEGG metabolic network and recording results in a excel table.OligoNet provides an additional network-based visualization of decomposition results named "Peptide degradation network" (PDN). Inspired from the previously-published <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22006638" target="_blank"> Kendrick analogous mass difference network </a>, the ab initio PDN infers all potential hydrolysis reactions (edges) between peptides (nodes). For instance, the mass signal that is decomposed into two alanines and two prolines (abbreviated as A2P2) is connected to "A2" in the network since A2 can be produced in a biological system by the hydrolysis of A2P2.
### Notice
OligoNet is primarily developed for processing mass spectrometry data that are already annotated to elemental formula (theoritical masses)  or measured from ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometer with high mass accuracy. 

### A) Start a new run
#### File 1 is the mass spectrum data in .txt, .csv or .dat format. The data file must organized as it is shown in table 1 with first row as headers. The columns must be separated by tabulations. The decimal places should be a point (".").

![Table 1.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/Tab1.JPG)  
^1 The second column must be a list of masses. We suggest that all mass values have the same number of digits after the decimal.   
^2 In further stage of the software, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between metabolic features. It is suggested to have at least P>10 samples for a reliable correlation calculation.

<Example> Wine metabolomics data from positive mode UPLC-MS: 
<a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Datasets/Wine_data.txt" target="_blank"> 
File 1 </a>  

#### File 2 (optional) must be a .txt, .csv or .dat file with headers and with columns separated by tabulation. It contains all additional information of each mass, such as their retention time, statistical scores ... These informations are going to be combined with peptide annotations and can be displayed on the network. The first column of the file must be IDs of masses. This column must be identical (same ids, in the same order) as in File 1. The decimal places should be a point (".").

<Example> Wine metabolomics data from positive mode UPLC-MS: 
<a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Datasets/Wine_data_add.txt" target="_blank"> 
File 2 </a>  

#### File 3 (optional) must be a two-column .txt, .csv or .dat file separated by tabulation. It represents the subunits that each mass signal is decomposed into. By default, the web server uses the 17 proteinogenic amino acids as subunits for decomposition. Users could modify the subunits by uploading the File 3. The data file must organized as it is shown in table 2 without headers. The decimal places should be a point (".").

![Table 2.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/Tab2.JPG)

^3 The first mass must correspond to the mass loss during condensation of two subunits. For instance, to form a dipeptides from two amino acids, the mass loss is a water. In current version you could only define one type of condensation reaction.
^4 The names of subunits are in the first column and must not contain numbers.
<Default amino acid file>: <a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Demo/amino-acid-full.txt" target="_blank"> File 3 </a>  

#### You need to specify the scan mode of the MS experiment. For positive ionization, the mass of a "H+" will be substarct from the experimental m/z before decomposition. For negative ionization, the mass of a "H+" will be added before decomposition. 

#### You need to specify maximal tolerance window (up to 0.5 Dalton) for peptide annotation. If your input mass is an exact mass (e.g., based on a reliable elemental formula annotation from another software), you could set this value to zero.

#### Users could perform the mass decomposition manually on <a href="https://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/decomp" target="_blank"> DECOMP </a>. During the data submission, the checkboxes "chemically plausible decompositions" and "actual mass for each decomposition" must be disabled and "deviation from query mass for each decomposition" must be enabled. OligoNet could use the Bielefeld server id (e.g. bibiserv2_2016-12-05_161538_XtQxM) for further analysis. 

#### Mass decomposition can be performed in two ways on OligoNet: i) using a recursive function written entirely in R <a href="http://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/dynamic-programming-coin-change-problem/" target="_blank"> Change-making problem </a> ii) by automatically requesting the web server <a href="https://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/decomp" target="_blank"> DECOMP </a>. The second solution is recommended for data containing more than 1000 features since it is more efficient and more reliable. The checkbox "Use DECOMP server" needs to be ticked if users decide to use the third party server. 

### B) Mass decomposition

#### <Download> When the decomposition is finished, a success message will appear in the tab-panel "A) Start a run" and users could download the decomposition results as .txt file. Four columns "NBP" (Number of possible amino acid combinations),"Peptides" (Peptide annotations), "PPM" (Annotation error in ppm for each annotation), "KEGG" (Annotated kegg compound code) will be added to the end of the original dataset.

<Example> Annotated wine metabolomics data from positive mode UPLC-MS: 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/Wine_annotated.txt" target="_blank"> 
Annnotated </a>

#### Decomposition results are displayed on the tab-panels "UAAC-Annotation" and "MAAP-Annotation". UAAC mass signals are mass values that are annotated as a Unique Amino Acid Combination; MAAP are annotated as Multiple Amino Acid Combinations.

### C) Network construction

####  A peptide degradation network is constructed using UAAC mass signals. The PDN is a hypothetical metabolic network that collects all potential hydrolysis reactions between annotated peptides. Users could choose to simplify the network in following ways:
1. By deleting triangles
2. By omitting monomers (here free amino acids) from the network since these high degree vertices could remarkably increase the network complexity.
3. Based on the Spearman correlation coefficient (between -1 and 1), it is possible to keep only edges that connect highly correlated nodes (e.g. between 0.8 and 1 or between -1 and -0.8), since a high correlation indicates a strong biochemical dependence between coexisting peptides. 

#### Users could choose which variable (in File 2) will be displayed when the mouse points to the node. In addition, users could color certain nodes red according to its value in the selected variable (e.g. color all potential biomarkers red).

### Network results

#### <Download> When the network construction is finished, a success message will appear in the tab-panel "C) Network construction". The network file contains three columns describing all edges in the network: source node id, target node id and transformation (amino acid difference between connected nodes). It can be download as a .txt file and be exported to softwares such as Cytoscape for further analysis. 

<Example> Network built from annotated wine metabolomics data: 
<a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Demo/Wine_network.txt" target="_blank">
Network </a>

#### An interactive network visualization is displayed in the tab-panel "Entire PDN". Users could zoom in/out and drag in order to displace the nodes.  

#### Network analysis: OligoNet suggests several graph analysis of the PDN
1. Degree distribution: The degree distribution (in + out degree) of all vertices in the PDN
2. Edge distribution: The occurences of edges (different types of degradation reactions) in the PDN
3. Top 20% most frequent edges
4. Path length distribution: All paths in the PDN are extracted. Here we plot the distribution of their length. For instance, the path \"A2P2 %->% A1P2 %->% P2%->% P1\" has a length 3.
5. Spearman correlation distribution: Distribution of correlation coefficients between connected vertices

#### Subgraphs: It could also extract some interesting subgraphs from the network.
1. High degree vertices: high in-degree nodes with its 1st, 2nd... -order neighbouring nodes. We call it also "Common Pattern" region.
2. Degradation chains: long paths in the network, all subgraphs can be downloaded as an network file.

### Peptides in KEGG

#### KEGG pathway maps are generated according to the selected organism. In the selected pathway map, both annotated peptides and other identified metabolites in the dataset are highlighted using different colors: red=peptides, blue= other metabolites. This function allows a simultaneous visualization of peptides along with other key metabolites in the sample studied.
