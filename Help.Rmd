### Help

Recent technical advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) have made metabolomics experiments commonplace for a wide variety of disciplines. In most studies, a database search is performed to translate mass signals into concrete metabolites, and to further interpret the data in a biological and genomic context. However, this annotation approach is limited by the size of database, therefore many detected mass signals are classified as unknowns without being further considered. OligoNet implements an alternative method to annotate metabolomics data based on the assumption that some higher-molecular-weight "unknowns" are combinations of repeated subunits (residues). The current version of the web server is dedicated to provide putative annotations of peptides in full scan direct infusion MS or LC/GC-MS data. For this purpose, OligoNet attempts to decompose each mass input into a combination(s) of  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/amino-acid-full.txt" target="_blank"> 17 proteinogenic amino acids </a>. It either uses a recursive algorithm or requests the third-party web server <a href="https://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/decomp" target="_blank"> DECOMP </a>. OligoNet provides  user-friendly ouputs for metabolomic experiments, including the display of decomposition results on the web interface, parallel KEGG database annotation, visualization of annotated peptides in KEGG metabolic network and recording results in a excel table.OligoNet provides an additional network-based visualization of decomposition results named "Peptide degradation network" (PDN). Inspired from the previously-published <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22006638" target="_blank"> Kendrick analogous mass difference network </a>, the ab initio PDN infers all potential hydrolysis reactions (edges) between peptides (nodes). For instance, the mass signal that is decomposed into two alanines and two prolines (abbreviated as A2P2) is connected to "A2" in the network since A2 can be produced in a biological system by the hydrolysis of A2P2.
### Notice
OligoNet is primarily developed for processing low-molecular-weight metabolomics data that are already annotated to elemental formula (theoritical masses)  or measured from ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometer with high mass accuracy. To keep a reasonable computational time, the preferred mass range for the software is between 100-1200 Da and the data should not contain more than 20 000 mass features. Masses over 1500 Da could sometimes be rejected from the server. 

### A) Start a new run
#### File 1 is compulsory for running the software. It should be mass spectrum data in .txt, .csv or .dat format. The data file must organized as it is shown in table 1 with first row as headers. The columns must be separated by tabulations. The decimal places should be a point (".").The IDs can be either numeric, alphabetic or the mixture of both.

![Table 1.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/Tab1.JPG)  
^1 The second column must be a list of masses. We suggest that all mass values should be rounded to same number of digits after the decimal.   
^2 In further stage of the software, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between metabolic features. It is suggested to have at least P>10 samples for a reliable correlation calculation.

<Example> Wine metabolomics data from positive mode UPLC-MS: 
<a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Datasets/Wine_data.txt" target="_blank"> 
File 1 </a>  

#### File 2 (optional) must be a .txt, .csv or .dat file with headers and with columns separated by tabulation. It contains all additional information of each mass, such as their retention time, statistical scores ... These informations are going to be combined with peptide annotations and can be displayed on the network. The first column of the file must be IDs of masses. This column must be identical (same ids, in the same order) as in File 1. The decimal places should be a point (".").

<Example> Wine metabolomics data from positive mode UPLC-MS: 
<a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Datasets/Wine_data_add.txt" target="_blank"> 
File 2 </a>  

#### File 3 (optional) must be a two-column .txt, .csv or .dat file separated by tabulation. It represents the subunits that each mass signal should be decomposed into. By default, the web server uses the 19 proteinogenic amino acids as subunits for decomposition (with no distinction between Leucine and Isolencine and both are annotated as "L"). Users could modify the subunits by uploading the File 3. The data file must organized as it is shown in table 2 without headers. The decimal places should be a point (".").

![Table 2.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/Tab2.JPG)

^3 The first mass must correspond to the mass loss during condensation of two subunits. For instance, to form a dipeptides from two amino acids, the mass loss is a water. In current version you could only define one type of condensation reaction.
^4 The names of subunits are in the first column and must not contain numbers.
<Default amino acid file>: <a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/amino-acid-complete.txt" target="_blank"> File 3 </a>  

#### You need to specify the scan mode of the MS experiment. Leave it as default if you already pre-corrected to make the masses neutral. For positive ionization, the mass of a "H+" will be substracted from the experimental m/z before decomposition. For negative ionization, the mass of a "H+" will be added before decomposition. 

#### You need to specify maximum error tolerance (up to 0.5 Dalton) that represents the estimated instrumental mass error. If your input mass is an exact mass (e.g., based on a reliable elemental formula annotation from another software), you could set this value to zero. The third party algorithm DECOMP generates a minor computational error, but it is considered by OligoNet. 

#### Users could perform the mass decomposition manually on <a href="https://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/decomp" target="_blank"> DECOMP </a>. During the data submission, the checkboxes "chemically plausible decompositions" and "actual mass for each decomposition" must be disabled and "deviation from query mass for each decomposition" must be enabled. OligoNet could use the Bielefeld server id (e.g. bibiserv2_2017-08-09_104549_KFLJT) for further analysis. 

#### Mass decomposition can be performed in three ways on OligoNet: i) using a recursive function written entirely in R <a href="http://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/dynamic-programming-coin-change-problem/" target="_blank"> Change-making problem </a> ii) by automatically requesting the web server <a href="https://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/decomp" target="_blank"> DECOMP </a>. The second solution is recommended for data containing more than 1000 features since it is more efficient and more reliable. The checkbox "Use DECOMP server" needs to be ticked if users decide to use the third party server. iii) after each decomposition, OligoNet will communicate a job id (e.g. bibiserv2_2017-08-09_104549_KFLJT). If you want re-run the same dataset that already tested before, you could enter this id, which will save you some time.

### B) Mass decomposition

#### <Download> When the decomposition is finished, a success message will appear in the tab-panel "A) Start a run" and users could download the decomposition results as .txt file. Four columns "NBP" (Number of possible amino acid combinations),"Peptides" (Peptide annotations), "PPM" (Annotation error in ppm for each annotation), "KEGG" (Annotated kegg compound code) will be added to the end of the original dataset.

<Example> Annotated wine metabolomics data from positive mode UPLC-MS: 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/master/Demo/Wine_annotated.txt" target="_blank"> 
Annnotated </a>

#### Decomposition results are displayed on the tab-panels "UAAC-Annotation" and "MAAP-Annotation". UAAC mass signals are mass values that are annotated as a Unique Amino Acid Combination; MAAP are annotated as Multiple Amino Acid Combinations.

### C) Network construction

####  A peptide degradation network is constructed using UAAC mass signals. The PDN is a hypothetical metabolic network that collects all potential hydrolysis reactions between annotated peptides. Users could modify the network construction in following ways:
1. By including or not isolated nodes (the ones without connections to any other nodes)
2. By deleting triangles in the network
3. By omitting monomers (here free amino acids) from the network since these high degree vertices could remarkably increase the network complexity.
4. Based on the Spearman correlation coefficient (between -1 and 1), it is possible to keep only edges that connect highly correlated nodes (e.g. between 0.8 and 1 or between -1 and -0.8), since a high correlation indicates a strong biochemical dependence between coexisting peptides. 
####  Once the network is successfully contructed, a table of connections (source peptide - target peptide - degradation) will be displayed underneath. This table can be also downloaded as a ".txt" file, adapted for importing to visualization softwares such as Gephi.
<Example> Network built from annotated wine metabolomics data: 
<a href="https://github.com/daniellyz/OligoNet/blob/master/Demo/Wine_network.txt" target="_blank">
Network </a>

### Network results

#### Sub-tabpanel "Network visualzation" displays the entire network: Users could choose to visualize one or more node features (ID, mass, intensity of a specific sample, retention time, etc.) in File 1 and File 2 by displaying the selected information next to the nodes, by displaying the selected information of the node when mouse is over it, by colouring the nodes red if they belong to a certain group (when the selected node feature is a qualitative descriptor of samples) or by applying a colour gradient according to a quantitative node feature (e.g. intensity): the more intense the blue colour is, the higher is the value of the selected node feature. For edge features, they could choose to display (when mouse is over the edges) Edge ID, amino acid loss or statistical correlations.
#### After setting all visualization options, by clicking on "Visualize entire network", an interactive network visualization will be displayed. Users could zoom in/out and drag in order to displace the nodes.

#### Sub-tabpanel "Network analysis" suggests several graph analysis of the PDN:
1. Degree distribution: The degree distribution (in + out degree) of all vertices in the PDN
2. Edge distribution: The occurences of edges (different types of degradation reactions) in the PDN
3. Top 20% most frequent edges
4. Path length distribution: All paths in the PDN are extracted. Here we plot the distribution of their length. For instance, the path "A2P2 -> A1P2 -> P2-> P1" has a length 3.
5. Spearman correlation distribution: Distribution of correlation coefficients between connected vertices

#### Sub-tabpanel "Subgraphs"" allows the extraction of some interesting subgraphs from the network:
1. High degree vertices: high in-degree nodes with its 1st, 2nd... -order neighbouring nodes. We call it also "Common Pattern" region.
2. Degradation chains: long paths in the network, all subgraphs can be downloaded as an network file.
#### All visualization options in the sub-tabpanel "Network visualzation" will be applied for visualization of subgraphs.

### Peptides in KEGG

#### KEGG pathway maps are generated according to the selected organism. In the selected pathway map, both annotated peptides and other identified metabolites in the dataset are highlighted using different colors: red=peptides, blue= other metabolites. This function allows a simultaneous visualization of peptides along with other key metabolites in the sample studied.
